				<td><p>This practical manual can guide programmes hoping to create and facilitate critical reflection and action on harmful masculinities and their effects on the lives of women, girls and men themselves. The manual contains 13 activity-based group sessions, as well as guidelines for session facilitation. The goal is to encourage men to actively promote gender equality in their own lives, in their households and in the larger community with individual sessions focusing on things like promoting shared financial and household decision-making between partners, increasing negotiation and communication skills via cross-gender dialogue and understanding how to stop cycles of violence, including economic violence. There is also a tool to guide facilitators in the development of community-based campaigns.</p></td>
