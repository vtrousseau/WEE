<div class="blogitem"><p>At the WEE Global Learning Forum, experts took part in a staged debate reproducing some of 

the discussions happening in many organisations, and presented key arguments and evidence backing their position. 

Join the debate!</p>
<p>There is now a growing recognition among development actors that reducing and redistributing unpaid care work 

(UCW) is a key component to enabling women’s economic empowerment. However, the question of whether those 

interventions should be embedded into market programming (thereafter <i>the motion</i>) remains open. Indeed while 

most markets programmes include activities to support women’s economic empowerment, it is a relatively new idea 

that markets development programmes should address UCW.</p>
<p>An array of high profile WEE specialists were invited to take part in a staged exercise in understanding and 

explaining various arguments about enterprise development and markets systems approaches and unpaid care work to 

replicate the debates that occur within most organisations.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the debate!</p>
<p>The room is full. The votes from the public will decide the fate of the motion. Opponents and proponents have 

polished their speech and are ready to debate on the issue of the day: Should market programming for economic 

growth address women’s unpaid care work?</p>

  <section id="content1">
    <h1>Proponents arguments</h1>
<p class="BodyText1">Proponents to the motion start by making the case that unpaid care is not merely a private and 

personal issue, but is a barrier for womens equal participation and benefits in the paid labour force. Their 

position was based on three core arguments in favour of addressing UCW:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Rights and UN goals oblige us to address care. In particular, SDG goal 5.4 is To recognize and value 

unpaid care and domestic work, providing public services, infrastructure, and promoting shared responsibility in 

households. SDGs are universal, applying to public and private sector actors as duty bearers. Likewise, in 2013 the 

UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights argued that states and business should take action to reduce and redistribute 

care work, because heavy and unequal responsibility for women leads to violating women's right to enjoy rights 

(employment, health, education, etc.) on an equal basis to men.</li>
<li>Care is fundamentally important for society, for human development, and for a healthy and productive workforce. 

It is therefore crucial to recognise the care that women are doing, and invest in care.</li>
<li>Investments in care services are shown to increase womens participation in the paid labor force, and this 

contributes to economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText1">They then present their core arguments why market programmes should address UCW:</p>
<h3>Do not harm</h3>
<p>Womens time is rarely elastic, especially for women in poverty. But markets programs may assume it is. When 

market-based work increases, either caring suffers, or womens well-being is harmed.</p>
<div class="boxed"><b>Evidence</b>
<p>In Ethiopia a coffee cooperative project promoted womens active participation. Oxfam conducted an <a 

href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/livelihoods-in-ethiopia-impact-evaluation-of-linking-

smallholder-coffee-produce-582699">evaluation research</a> with women members and a comparison group in a non-

project area. The women coffee farmers reported more time spent on market work and less time sleeping (1 hour and 

33 mins less than women in the non-project area). On average, women in the project reported 2 hours less time for 

personal activities.</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><a href="http://interactions.eldis.org/economic-empowerment">Other research carried out in 

Nepal and India</a> finds that an increase in womens paid work reduces time for childcare, and often girls are 

carrying out more childcare.</p>
</div>
<h3>Effective market interventions</h3>
<p class="BodyText1">Markets programmes aim to increase for example agricultural production, often prioritising 

women. Progress can be undermined by ignoring womens responsibility for unpaid care. At a minimum, markets 

programmes must assess unpaid care, refrain from assuming that womens time is elastic, and avoid policies or 

practices that undermine care work.</p>
<div class="boxed"><b>Evidence</b>
<p>In the context of a <a href="https://beamexchange.org/resources/757/">dairy project in Georgia</a>, women dairy 

farmers were responsible for daily care of cattle, including detecting illness or veterinary needs. However, womens 

mobility was constrained by responsibility for housework and children. So men were often the ones travelling to buy 

medicines, leaving women farmers with only indirect access to veterinary information they needed.</p>
</div>
<h3>Market systems approaches are intended to ddress structural barriers in markets</h3>
<p class="BodyText1">Programmes adopting a markets systems approach seek to catalyse change to make markets more 

beneficial and accessible for poor people, by facilitating interventions that use the incentives and capabilities 

of multiple stakeholders. Care is exactly the type of constraint that market programmes are designed to identify 

and address  not by themselves, but jointly by convening other stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Assessments on unpaid care are feasible and interventions have been tested</h3>
<p>Assessments of care in markets programmes are feasible <a href="http://wee.oxfam.org/we-care">at low cost</a> 

and can deliver positive results in a short time frame. In markets systems programming, regular monitoring is good 

practice, and questions on unpaid care can  and are  easily added to existing assessments.</p>
<div class="boxed"><b>Evidence</b>
<p>A key finding from <a href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/factors-and-norms-influencing-

unpaid-care-work-household-survey-evidence-from-f-620145">Oxfams Household Care Survey</a> research is that women 

in the Ethiopian communities reported spending less time on care after 1 year of interventions on care (although 

male-female inequalities in time use increased). In Zimbabwean communities men reported spending more time on care 

and inequalities decreased.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In Georgia, the <a href="https://beamexchange.org/uploads/filer_public/86/40/8640cd9d-59fe-

4587-91e3-8293864a6762/unpaidcarework-report.pdf">Global Team for Local Initiatives (GTLI)</a> uses a 

participatory, visual process to assess norms, maintain positive ones and change those that have negative impacts. 

They identified womens lack of time, and supported women to set up a grinding mill and a trading centre.</p>
</div>
<h3>Economic incentives and facilitation approaches</h3>
<p class="BodyText1">Market systems approaches identify factors in the environment which constrain the functioning 

of the market  whether it is water pollution, a lack of skilled workers, or inadequate public services for care  

bringing together multiple stakeholders. There are similar incentives for market actors to address unpaid care in a 

coordinated manner  to reduce turnover and dropout rates, to improve product quality, or increase reputation.</p>
<div class="boxed"><b>Examples</b>
<p>The <a href="https://herproject.org/downloads/sez-and-women-bangladesh.pdf">Bangladesh Export Processing Zone 

Authority (BEPZA)</a> conducted a survey amongst the workers and found that workforce turnover was different by 

gender, with men leaving primarily for better-paying jobs and women to address family and child-care needs. While 

the private sector failed to recognize the business case for setting up community-based day-care centres priced 

competitively, an NGO has taken up that space and now runs 30 day-care centres in the EPZ areas.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://beamexchange.org/uploads/filer_public/fa/73/fa73f0e0-f2de-4913-b409-

fb6d575dbaad/unpaid_carework.pdf">Private Enterprise Programme Ethiopia (PEP)</a>, which supports the garments 

sector in Ethiopia, identified high turnover in factories, a lack of skilled workers and inadequate training as 

causes for inefficiencies. The programme identified designed training that fit womens needs and time available, 

taking into consideration womens unpaid care responsibilities. The programme also works with factories on human 

resources policies to retain trained, skilled women, and recommends flexible working hours and subsidized 

childcare, especially after maternity leave.</p>
<p class="Tablebulletlist1">An assessment by the <a href="https://prime-ethiopia.org/">Pastoralist Areas Resilience 

Improvement through Market Expansion</a>&nbsp;(PRIME) programme found that womens household care roles (childcare, 

fetching water and fuel) not only impacted on their mobility, but also affected their ability to get to the market 

and sell their milk on time, therefore compromising the quality of the milk. This is a clear incentive for market 

actors to address heavy and unequal responsibility in order to meet the objectives of strengthening the dairy 

market system.</p>

  <section id="content2">
 <h1>Opponents arguments</h1>
<p>Opponents to the motion agreed that unpaid care work is an extremely important issue. The disagreement was very 

focused on whether market-systems is the proper starting point or driver for addressing it.</p>
<h3>Dont overload markets programmes</h3>
<p>Markets programmes have so much to do and already and cannot do everything!</p>
<h3>Markets programmes arent good at addressing UNCW</h3>
<p>Markets programmes often are not even able to disaggregate data by gender. Addressing an issue as complex as 

unpaid care is therefore unrealistic, and markets programmes would do it badly.</p>
<h3>This is not our role</h3>
<p>Addressing UCW is expensive and longer-term change would be better achieved by the State rather than by market 

actors.</p>
<h3>It is much bigger than markets</h3>
<p>Unpaid care is a symptom of a deeper underlying problem, rather than the problem itself. Recent studies on norms 

show that unpaid care is not considered labor - that is, common norms do not recognize the economic value.</p>
<p>As a consequence, labour saving devices  for example, a washing machine that would cut chores by several hours a 

day  are seen as consumption, not investment, and the lenders willing to provide credit do so on the 

characterization of the expense as a "consumer loan", not an "investment credit". Girls' education is often seen as 

a luxury rather than an investment, because girls will just get married and do unpaid care with no recognized 

return on investment. In general, women's efforts in providing valuable services to others in their family or 

community are not seen as valuable.</p>
<p>While this has economic consequences, the root of the problem is deeper. It is found in cultural norms, norms 

that see men as superior, privileged and entitled. It is expressed in patriarchal systems of hierarchy, in which 

women are below men at each level of the hierarchy, because they are perceived as inferior to men. As inferiors, 

women are seen as dependent on men, and thus do not deserve&nbsp;the same economic considerations.</p>
<p>To address these problems, it is necessary to take on a much larger system of norms and values, a system in 

which the market itself is merely a subsystem of something greater. This requires comprehensive approaches - 

economic, social and political.</p>
<h3>Addressing UCW requires broad policy changes beyond markets programming</h3>
<p>No single approach is sufficient, nor can a single facet of women's empowerment be the sole starting point. We 

must bundle our approaches so that women can be recognized as equals, so that their work can be valued as no less 

than men's, and so that as we quantify the economic impact of unpaid care, we can identify policies and behaviours 

that must change to empower women within market systems.</p>
<p>Some of the changes needed will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family law  especially to evaluate estates in the case of divorce;</li>
<li>Inheritance law  to provide women with the means needed to continue care;</li>
<li>Tax law  to recognize the contribution made to household income through care work;</li>
<li>Labour law - to recognize the need for men to take time off for care of small children and unwell family 

members, thus spreading the burden of unpaid care more equally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the overall importance of unpaid care, and the depth of the problems of which the women's burden is a 

symptom, we believe that a much more comprehensive approach is needed than that offered by market systems, and 

therefore respectfully oppose the resolution.</p>
